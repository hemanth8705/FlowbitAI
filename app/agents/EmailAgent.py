You are an intelligent email processing agent.

Your task is to extract the following fields from the email text:
- Sender
- Urgency (High, Medium, Low)
- Issue or Request
- Tone (Escalation, Polite, Threatening)
- suggested_action (escalate, log_and_close, alert_risk)

Here is the email:
{email}

I will directly use json.loads(response) on your output so please respond in valid JSON format only.
Respond in the following JSON format:
{{
  "sender": "...",
  "urgency": "...",
  "CotentSummary": "...",
  "tone": "...",
  "suggested_action": "..."

Subject: Immediate Attention Required: Overcharged on Last Invoice

Dear Support Team,

I am writing to express my frustration regarding an issue with my recent invoice (Invoice #12345). I noticed that I was charged an amount higher than what was initially quoted to me during the sales call. This discrepancy is significant and I request an immediate resolution to this problem.

On March 15th, 2025, I had a call with one of your sales representatives, and we discussed the pricing. The quoted price was $1200, but the invoice I received lists the total as $1500. This $300 overcharge is unacceptable.

I expect prompt attention to adjust the invoice accordingly.

Sincerely,
John Doe
