Subject: Defective Product: Request for Replacement or Refund

Dear Customer Support Team,

I am writing to file a complaint regarding a defective product that I purchased from your online store. On April 18, 2025, I purchased a Smart Home Security System (Model: SHS-2025), and unfortunately, the system has stopped functioning properly just a few weeks after installation.

The issues I am facing are as follows:

Motion Detection Failure:
The motion sensor no longer detects movement properly. It worked fine for the first few days, but now it doesn’t trigger the alarm when someone enters the room. This makes the system essentially useless.

App Connectivity Issue:
The mobile app is unable to connect to the security system, even after multiple attempts to reset the app and the system. The Wi-Fi signal strength is fine, but the system simply won’t sync with the app.

I have attempted to contact your support team via phone, but unfortunately, I have not received any response yet. As I rely heavily on this system for my home security, I would appreciate it if you could resolve this matter as soon as possible.

I would either like a replacement unit or a full refund for the product. I have attached the proof of purchase, along with the warranty details. Please let me know the next steps for resolving this issue.

Thank you for your prompt assistance. I look forward to your quick response.

Sincerely,
Sarah Lee
