Subject: Invoice Discrepancy on INV-12345

Dear Accounts Team,

I hope youâ€™re doing well. I am reaching out regarding Invoice #12345, which was issued on May 25, 2025. Upon reviewing the invoice, I noticed a few discrepancies that I need clarification on.

Overcharged Items:
On the invoice, I have been charged for 3 units of product "ABC-123", but I only ordered 2 units. I have attached the original purchase order (PO-3456) as proof of this.

Incorrect Shipping Charges:
The shipping charges listed as $50 are incorrect. According to the agreement, shipping should have been free as part of the promotion I signed up for.

Missing Discount:
There was a 10% discount offered for bulk orders, which I believe was not applied to my invoice. Could you please apply this discount retroactively and provide an updated invoice?

I would appreciate it if you could look into these issues and provide a revised invoice. If any additional information is required from my side, please let me know. I expect to receive the corrected invoice by June 5, 2025.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

Sincerely,
Michael Brown
