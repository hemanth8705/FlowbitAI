Subject: Immediate Attention Required: Overcharged on Last Invoice

Dear Support Team,

I am writing to express my frustration regarding an issue with my recent invoice (Invoice #12345). I noticed that I was charged an amount higher than what was initially quoted to me during the sales call. The discrepancy is significant, and I request an immediate resolution to this problem.

On March 15th, 2025, I had a call with one of your sales representatives, and we discussed the pricing for the software package I purchased. The quoted price was $1200, but the invoice I received lists the total as $1500. This $300 overcharge is not something I can overlook, and I would like it resolved at the earliest.

Furthermore, I am concerned about the lack of transparency in the invoicing process. The breakdown of charges is unclear, and it doesnâ€™t match the details provided in our agreement. Can you please provide me with a detailed explanation of how these charges were calculated?

I have attached a copy of the invoice and the email correspondence from the sales representative. Please look into this matter urgently and adjust the invoice accordingly. If I do not hear back from you within the next 48 hours, I will have no choice but to escalate this issue.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter. I expect to hear back from you soon with an update on the resolution.

Sincerely,
John Doe
